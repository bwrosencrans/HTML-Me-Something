    <h2> Launch Code Student </h2>
    <h3> Bio: </h3>
    <p> I was born and raised in St. Louis.  I recently graduated from Southeast Missouri State with my Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration.  My goal for this course it to, 1) graduate, and 2) become proficient in coding so that I can apply it in my career. </p>
    <p> Prior to Launch Code, I did not forsee myself going into a tech-related career.  So far, the course has been quite challenging.  I believe that overcoming a challenge is the most rewarding kind of work.  I am more so project-management and sales-oriented, but expanding my skillset is important to me.  </p>
    <p> On a final note, I want to be able to provide a good life for my family; since the tech industry is in dire need of people with this skillset, I am striving to become better at it each day.  It is a lot of information for twenty weeks, like drinking water from a fire hose, but I know that hard work pays off.</p>
